This is a simple web application designed to help individuals track their income and expenses. Users can input different types of income and expenses, categorize them, and view various reports, such as summaries by period (monthly, yearly, custom) or by category.

This project is being built using Python and the FastAPI framework for the backend, with basic server-rendered HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the initial frontend.
