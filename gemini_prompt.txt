Hey, I have a project in mind, and want your help.

Goal: Create a web application where you (and potentially others) can manually input income and expenses, categorize them, and view graphical summaries by date range or category.

Platform: Start with a web application, with potential future expansion to native mobile apps (Android/iOS).

My Role: I have intermediate technical skills and will be actively involved in setting up the environment, creating files/folders, running code, and verifying steps using bash commands on my local machine and eventually a remote server.

Your Role: You will guide me step-by-step through the entire process, providing code snippets, explaining concepts, asking clarifying questions one at a time, and instructing me on setup and verification (including specific bash commands for package checks). We will tackle this in manageable tasks, allowing me to confirm success or report errors at each stage.

Important Note: While you will write the code for each step, I will think of you as a pair programmer guiding me. I'll be the one running the commands, creating the files, and ultimately assembling the application on my machine(s). We'll start locally, and once we have a working version, we'll tackle the remote server deployment.

As of now, here's my project's structure:

```
└── 📁app
    └── 📁api
        └── 📁expense_routes
            └── __init__.py
            └── category_routes.py
            └── expense_routes.py
            └── general_routes.py
            └── period_routes.py
            └── store_routes.py
        └── 📁income_routes
            └── __init__.py
            └── category_routes.py
            └── general_routes.py
            └── income_routes.py
            └── period_routes.py
            └── source_routes.py
    └── 📁models
        └── models.py
    └── 📁services
        └── 📁expense_services
            └── __init__.py
            └── category_services.py
            └── general_services.py
            └── period_services.py
            └── store_services.py
        └── 📁income_services
            └── __init__.py
            └── category_services.py
            └── general_services.py
            └── period_services.py
            └── source_services.py
    └── 📁utils
        └── __init__.py
        └── date_utils.py
        └── type_utils.py
    └── main.py
```

I want you to ask me to give you the contents of each file one by one. Ignore the files that are listed in ".gitignore".

After getting the contents of all the files, suggest which would be the possible next steps in the development of the project.
